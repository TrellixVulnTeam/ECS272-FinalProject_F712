# Marine Litter-ature
Every year large amounts of plastic enters our oceans. As plastic is particularly durable, the mass of plastic debris in the world’s oceans is steadily increasing – often with fatal consequences for countless sea creatures. Microscopic breakdown products from plastics, which scientists have only recently started to study in detail, may also pose a threat. Although the problem has existed for some time, there is still no effective strategy in place to turn the tide on marine litter.

##
A lot of this plastic happens to wash off on the beaches. Cleaning these beaches is necessary not only for beautification but also for the fact that it in turn provides economic benefit to local communities in the form of tourism dollars. Beach cleanups raise public awareness to the threat of debris more effectively than in less participatory public education programs, multiple studies show. Volunteers say the cleanups make them more mindful of how they dispose of their own disposables.

The "**European Environment Agency**" developed the "**Marine LitterWatch**"- app to keep track of all the efforts made to keep our beaches clean. It has data about organizations that made an effort to clean beaches along with specific data about beaches themselves such as length, name, country, location, type, and the different types of litter found on the beaches. The data also has different types of debris/litter classified into different groups depending on the nature/material of the litter.

Our project tells a story on the various kinds of litters found on beaches in Europe. Along with this, we want to be able to convey the demographics and change in the pattern of types of litter over the years.
